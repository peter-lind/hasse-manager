Indigo Project documentation
=============================

We have extensive experience and expertise in developing organic chemistry software products for use in pharmaceutical 
companies, research institutes, and universities. At the same time, we have been developing internally a number of 
cheminformatics tools, and in 2009, we decided to contribute these tools to the open-source community.
